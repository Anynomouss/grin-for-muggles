## Objective
The objective of this site is to provide documentation to help muggles and aspiring wizards to better understand Grin. I specifically use the word "Grin" and not "mimblewimble" since I want to be as practically orietented and very explicit in this documentation. I hope it will help you on your journey down the Grin rabbit hole. Writing this documentation  certainly helped me to achieve greater clarity.
